# Supernova Instruction Set

A reduced instruction set designed to be the first compiler target,
opcodes and behaviors might change in future releases.

## Compiling 

To compiling the project, you will need
 - [CMAKE](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.5 or higher) to build

## Instruction Layouts

This table defines how are the instruction types laid out, bit by bit,
with the most significant bit first.

R type instructions (R standing for register) are instructions that
use 3 registers and normally operate as `rd <- r1 â—‹ r2`, as `r1`
referring to the first argument (and not register r01) and r2
referring to the second argument (and not register r02). Register
`rd` is the destination register, nothing stops `rd` to be `r1` or
`r2`

instruction type | bits 63-20 | bits 19-16 | bits 15-12 | bits 11-8 | bits 7-0
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
R type | unused | rd | r2 | r1 | op

instruction type | bits 63-16 | bits 15-12 | bits 11-8 | bits 7-0

## Register Layouts

`r00` is hardwired to zero, `r01` and `r02` are required for the interrupt stack

register index | used as | requirements
:-: | :-:               | :-:
r00 | zero register     | none, writing to is a no-op
r01 | stack pointer     | needs to be valid for `pcall`
r02 | frame pointer     | needs to be vaild for `pcall`
r03 - r12 | general use | none
r13 | `pcall` return    | save before pcall 
r14 | `pcall` return    | save before pcall 
r15 | `pcall` parameter | function switch

## interrupts

### default interrupts/exceptions used by the virtual machine

- `pcall -1`: [Processor interface](#pcall--1)
- `pcall 0`: Divison by zero
- `pcall 1`: General fault
- `pcall 2`: Double fault
- `pcall 3`: Triple fault
- `pcall 4`: Invalid instruction
- `pcall 5`: Page fault
- `pcall 6`: Invalid IO

everything after this is programmable (in theory), but some different
implementations might use other values

#### `pcall 0`: Division by zero

As the name suggests, this program call is triggered every time there is
a division by zero on the program. A compiler can simply put a divide by zero
instruction on a program and call it a breakpoint

#### `pcall 1`: General Fault

General faults occur by any kind of unhandled exception the processor is not
able to detect or recognize

#### `pcall 2`: Double Fault

A double fault occurs when any interrupt is called/triggered by a general fault

#### `pcall 3`: Triple Fault

A triple fault is one of the fatal faults inside the processor. There is no way 
to handle a triple fault as it probably suggests a fault in the error handling
system, and not making software handle prevents crash loops. If it is ever triggered
the processor is able to choose to go for a reset or a shutdown 

## `pcall -1`

Only `pcall -1` is hardware/vm defined, all the other $2^{51}-1$ possible interrupts are programmable with a call to `pcall -1`:

The interface defined uses r15 split in two 32bit areas `intspace:fswitch` as interrupt space and functionality switches, while other registers are used accordingly as each function needs.
Normally, `fswitch = 0` will be a `instspace` implementation check, behaving as a `orr r14 r0 r0` in case `intspace`'s feature is not implmemented.

**`pcall -1` functions**

- `intspace = 0`: [interrupt vector functions](#interrupt-vector-interrupt-space)
- - `fswitch = 0`: [interrupt vector check](#interrupt-vector-check)
- - `fswitch = 1`: [interrupt vector enable](#interrupt-vector-enable)
- `intspace = 1`: [paging functions](#paging-interrupt-space)
- - `fswitch = 0`: [paging check](#paging-check)
- - `fswitch = 1`: [paging enable](#paging-enable)
- `intspace = 2`: [model information](#model-information-interrupt-space)
- - `fswitch = 0`: [model check](#model-check)
- - `fswitch = 1`: []
- `intspace = 3`: [hyper functions](#hyper-function-interrupt-space)
- - `fswitch = 0` [is hosted](#hyper-hosted)

### interrupt vector interrupt space

#### interrupt vector check

input registers: none

output registers:

- `r14`: `0` if no interrupts are possible, `pcall 0:0` is just a shadow to `orr r14, r0, r0`,  
         `1` if interrupts are possible, but only in the address specified by `r12`,  
         `2` if interrupts are possible anywhere defined by the program,  

- `r13`: in case `r14 == 1`, sets bit flags to which hardware interrupts are supported
         in case `r14 == 2`, defines the amount of interrupts the processor is able to handle

trashed registers: none

#### interrupt vector enable

input registers:

- `r14` (possibly): if `pcall 0:0` returned `2`, set the interrupt vector register to the specified pointer, ignored if not

output registers: none

trashed registers: none

---

### paging interrupt space

#### paging check

input registers: none

output registers:

- `r14`: set to the processor's amount of page level reach, 0 is unimplemented, 1 is linear paging or `â‰¥ 2` for multiple levels
- `r13`: in case `r31` is not zero, returns the processor's page size

trashed registers: none

---

### model information interrupt space

#### information check

input registers: none

output registers:

- `r15`: set if the processor is able to give more information about itself

trashed registers: none
